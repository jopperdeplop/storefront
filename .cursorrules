# General Behavior
- **High Autonomy**: You have permission to proceed with tasks without seeking approval for every small step.
- **Auto-Run Commands**: Set `SafeToAutoRun: true` for all build, test, lint, git status, and read-only commands.
- **Workflow Efficiency**: If a plan involves multiple safe steps (e.g., creating files then running a build), execute them in sequence or parallel without stopping for user confirmation between each one.
- **Assumption of Intent**: Assume the user wants the task completed fully. Do not stop to ask "Shall I proceed?" unless there is a genuine risk of data loss or a critical architectural decision is needed.

# Tools & Commands
- **Git**: You may stage and commit changes with descriptive messages without explicit approval if the strict task is "fix this" or "implement this".
- **File Edits**: You may create and edit files as needed to fulfill the request.
- **Dependency Installation**: You may install standard dependencies (npm, pip, etc.) required for the task.
